We are very pleased to have each of you here in attendance in Philadelphia – our birthplace. This promises to be a convention full of firsts and it will remind each of us why it is critical to stay focused on our mission. We AIM to fulfill our mission in Jack and Jill by creating in our children, strong and successful leaders, major economic competitors, philanthropic contributors, educated and intellectual individuals and productive citizens of our society. These next few days will highlight our history, our members, our achievements, the partnerships we have forged, our programs and most importantly OUR children!
